# Overview

Contains object used for transfering information across data wires (i.e. internet, server-to-server communication, etc). These objects help clients and servers exchange messages and relevant information.

Each DTO has a counterpart interface representing the invariant state after successful object validation. The interface type is what is used within a service, beyond the initial controller/service API layer.
